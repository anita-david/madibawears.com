### Handling PR Conflicts

Make sure all merge conflicts are resolved on your branch before making pull requests.

## 🧹 Code Style Rules

- **Framework**: React 18+ with functional components and hooks
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state, useState/useReducer for local state
- **File Naming**: PascalCase for components (`UserProfile.jsx`), camelCase for utilities (`useLocalStorage.js`)
- **ESLint**: All code must pass linting checks

📋 For detailed frontend standards and React ecosystem guidelines, see our [whitepaper]()

## 🔧 Development

### Tech Stack

- **React 18+** with functional components
- **React Router v6** for client-side routing
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **TanStack Query** for server state management
- **Vite** as build tool

### Component Guidelines

- Use PropTypes for runtime validation (optional)
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Write meaningful tests for components
